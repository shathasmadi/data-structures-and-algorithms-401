### Stacks and Queues
    Stack :contains objects that are pushed and popped according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle.
    Queue: contains objects that are enqueued and dequeued according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle.


### Challenge
Using a Linked List, Implement both a Stack, and a Queue:

## Approach & Efficiency
Time of all method : bigO(1)
Space of all methods:bigO(1)

### API

## Stack

+ push
Arguments: value
adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
+ pop
Arguments: none Returns: the value from node from the top of the stack Removes the node from the top of the stack
+ peek
Arguments: none
Returns: Value of the node located at the top of the stack
+ is empty
Arguments: none
Returns: Boolean indicating whether the stack is empty.

## Queue
   + enqueue
    Arguments: value
    adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
   + dequeue Arguments: none
    Returns: the value from node from the front of the queue
    Removes the node from the front of the queue
    + peek Arguments: none
    Returns: Value of the node located at the front of the queue
   + is empty
    Arguments: none Returns: Boolean indicating whether the queue is empty
